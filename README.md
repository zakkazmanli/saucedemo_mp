# Mini Automated Web Testing Project 

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to create a testing framework to support the automation testing of https://www.saucedemo.com/. This website was specifically created for the purposes of automation testing and as such supports multiple utilities of widely used websites, such as sign-in functionality and the ability to add items to a cart to be later checked out. This framework was to be created adhering to the POM design approach for automation testing, with the following tools used:

 - Selenium to enable simulations interactions with browser elements
 - SpecFlow to enable feature files to be written that mapped to user stories on our project board
 - Gherkin as a means of writing concise and readable acceptance criteria for user stories to represent user journeys on the website, which could then be mapped to test cases


## Project Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories are marked as completed and tested.
- [ ] All unit tests pass.
- [ ] The end product is pushed to GitHub by TBC on 12/02/2021
- [ ] The documentation is fully realised, with a comprehensive README.md describing sprint progress and outcomes.
